## Overview of Project

### Purpose
A Colorado Board of Elections committee entrusted me to finish the political race review of a recent local congressional election and it included:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. The voter turnout for each county
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8. The county with the highest turnout
